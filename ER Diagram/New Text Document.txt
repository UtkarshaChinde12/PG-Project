ER Diagram
The ER diagram can be represented visually as follows:

plaintext
Copy code
[User] ----< [Booking] >---- [Show] ----> [Movie]
  |                  |               |
  |                  v               v
[Payment] <----- [BookingDetails] >--< [Seat] ----> [Screen] ----> [Cinema]
Now, let's translate this into a detailed diagram.
