Visual ER Diagram
I'll provide a description of how the entities are connected:

User to Booking: A user can make multiple bookings. Each booking is linked to a single user.
Booking to Show: Each booking is for one specific show. A show can have multiple bookings.
Booking to Payment: Each booking has one associated payment.
BookingDetails to Booking: Each booking can include multiple booking details, linking each seat booked to the booking.
BookingDetails to Seat: Each booking detail is associated with a specific seat.
Show to Movie: Each show is linked to a specific movie. A movie can have multiple shows.
Seat to Show: Each seat is associated with a specific show.
You can use diagramming tools like draw.io, Lucidchart, or any ER diagram software to visually represent this structure. If you need further customization or a visual representation using a specific tool, please let me know!
